This project is a random walk generator built using Python and the Turtle Graphics library. A random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random process, that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Turtle Graphics library

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the following command in your terminal: `python random_walk.py`

## Customization

You can customize the program by adjusting the parameters in the `random_walk.py` file. 

## Enjoy the beautiful patterns generated by the random walk!
